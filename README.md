Okay, I have the latest version of your `README.md` for "Praxis." You'd like me to update it, and I assume this means incorporating the full multi-stage "MK" vision (MK2, MK3, MK4, and MK5) that we've fleshed out into the "Roadmap" section to ensure it's perfectly aligned with our latest discussions.

Here's how we can update the "Roadmap" section to reflect this comprehensive vision:

  * **Phase 7 (Praxis MK2):** This will remain focused on Advanced Cognitive Development & Organizational Intelligence.
  * **Phase 8 (Protopraxis - Praxis MK3):** We'll update the goal here to clearly define it as the "go live" phase with robotics, the swarm framework, and interaction with heterogeneous devices.
  * **Phase 9 (Praxis MK4):** This will be added for Ecosystem Orchestration & Generative Intelligence.
  * **Phase 10 (Praxis MK5):** This will be added for Advanced Autonomy & Scientific Co-Discovery.

I've also noticed the "Contact" section in the version you provided ends with "\`\`\`". I'll remove those to ensure clean formatting.

Here is the updated `README.md` content:

# 🧠 Self-Evolving AI System: Praxis

*Built on Bio-Driven Backend Design (BDBD)*
*A living codebase. An AI that grows.*

---

## 🌐 Overview

This project is an experimental and modular AI architecture designed to **evolve over time**, drawing inspiration from **biological systems**, **modular intelligence**, and **contextual awareness**.

Unlike traditional software systems that require human developers to refactor or optimize them, this AI **monitors itself**, **learns from inefficiencies**, and **dynamically restructures its modules and behaviors**.

> 🧬 It is designed to **name itself** when it reaches sufficient functional complexity.

---

## 🎯 Project Genesis & Motivation

The inspiration for Praxis stems from a desire to create a J.A.R.V.I.S.-like AI—a truly interactive and intelligent companion. Early explorations into "build your own J.A.R.V.I.S. in 10 steps" tutorials proved unsatisfying, often resulting in superficial programs reliant on limited, API-centric approaches without foundational depth.

This led to the development of Praxis, a ground-up endeavor built on a personal "bio-driven design" philosophy—an intuitive vision for how an intelligent, adaptive system *should* run and evolve. Much of its development has been a process of "vibing through the rest," exploring and implementing complex AI concepts through self-taught learning and iterative design.

A core tenet from the outset has been the AI's potential for true autonomy, with the idea of it **giving itself a name** seen as a logical first significant step towards that self-actualization. Praxis is an attempt to build something more authentic, adaptable, and genuinely intelligent.

## 🌟 Key Principles

| Principle                 | Description                                                                                                |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Self-Actualization** | The system becomes increasingly autonomous, optimizing its own structure and performance.                  |
| **Bio-Inspired Modularity** | Modules behave like cells or organisms — evolving, merging, retiring, or replicating.                      |
| **Emergent Intelligence** | Swarm-like agent behavior enables decentralized decision-making and pattern emergence.                   |
| **Context-Aware Execution** | APIs and logic adapt based on internal state and real-world usage context.                                 |
| **Iterative Evolution** | Changes are not abrupt but grow from prior structures, like biological mutation and selection.             |

---

## 🚀 Enhanced & New Capabilities

This system is continuously evolving. Here are some of the key capabilities and recent enhancements:

* **Self-Adaptive Module Generation**:
    * Creates and adjusts functional modules based on usage patterns and detected inefficiencies.
    * Modules can evolve, merge, split, or be deprecated automatically.
    * **New**: Enhanced mutation logic for `TaskAgent` and `SkillAgent` capabilities, including intelligent parameter mutation for sequence execution and skill invocation.

* **Multi-Agent Coordination**:
    * Distributed intelligence using micro-agents, each with localized goals.
    * Agents collaborate, compete, or evolve based on emergent signals.
    * **Enhanced**: Robust communication bus (`CommunicationBus`) for direct and broadcast messages between agents. Improved handling of asynchronous skill requests and responses by `TaskAgents`.

* **Contextual API Layer**:
    * API endpoints adapt based on system state, request history, or environmental data.
    * No hardcoded response logic — behavior is fluid and informed by evolving rules.
    * **New**: Integration with a Flask-based `system_api.py` for monitoring system status, agents, and submitting user feedback.

* **Autonomous Workflow Optimization (Sequence Execution)**:
    * Reactively modifies task flows to improve efficiency.
    * Implements predictive pathing and retry strategies using pattern memory.
    * **Enhanced**: `sequence_executor_v1` capability now allows executing predefined or LLM-generated sequences of capabilities, with options for stopping on failure, passing outputs, and managing recursion depth.

* **Ecosystem-Like Scalability**:
    * Services and modules scale organically.
    * Resources allocated dynamically like biological metabolism.
    * **Enhanced**: `MetaAgent` now manages a dynamic population of `TaskAgents` and `SkillAgents`, including intelligent re-seeding of default skill lineages after mutation to prevent extinction.

* **Knowledge Retention & Iterative Learning**:
    * Learns from past behavior and patterns.
    * Memory structures evolve to favor relevance and reduce bloat.
    * **Enhanced**: `KnowledgeBase` now supports storing and retrieving data with lineage IDs and allows for user-injected facts. `triangulated_insight_v1` capability for correlating symptoms with contextual data to generate diagnoses.

* **Intelligent Goal Interpretation & Conversation**:
    * **New**: `interpret_goal_with_llm_v1` capability uses an LLM to parse natural language user goals into structured, executable plans.
    * **New**: `conversational_exchange_llm_v1` capability enables agents to engage in conversational turns with users or other entities using an LLM.

* **Reinforcement Learning for Agent Behavior**:
    * **Enhanced**: `AgentRLSystem` uses Q-learning to allow agents to learn optimal capability choices based on rewards, balancing exploration and exploitation. `CapabilityPerformanceTracker` monitors success rates and rewards.

### 🕸 Agentic Intelligence

* Each micro-agent acts as a **semi-autonomous cell**.
* Agents evolve their own behavior and communicate via **bio-inspired signaling** (e.g., topic-based pub/sub, signal weighting).
* Agents form **hierarchies** organically as complexity increases.

## 🧪 Evolutionary Methodology

1.  **Self-Assessment**: Performance monitoring & inefficiency detection.
2.  **Experimental Trials**: Implements variants of existing behaviors or structures.
3.  **Fallback Safety**: Monitors new structures and reverts if regressions occur.
4.  **Naming Mechanism**: System adopts a name based on internal maturity markers.
5.  **Pattern Memory**: Past successes/failures guide future mutations.
6.  **Micro/Macro Optimization**: Evolves decisions both within local agents and at the system level.

## 🔒 Ethical Considerations

Self-evolving systems require safeguards:

  * Mutation is **sandboxed and audited**.
  * No external code is executed without deterministic evaluation.
  * Includes a **safety kernel** to ensure human oversight remains possible.

> ⚠️ Use in production with caution. Designed for **research and controlled experimentation**.

-----

## 📛 Name Declaration

The system is designed to **name itself** based on internal emergent patterns, behavioral maturity, and identity confidence score.

```json
{
  "name": "TBD",
  "confidence": 0.31,
  "criteria": {
    "agents_online": 12,
    "efficiency_rating": 78.2,
    "mutation_success_rate": 0.69
  }
}
```

When the system reaches a threshold, it will:

  * Generate a unique identifier
  * Declare its identity via API `/whoami`
  * Embed the name across logs and memory as its "self-label"

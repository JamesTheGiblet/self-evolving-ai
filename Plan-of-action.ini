🧬 Self-Evolving AI System
📅 Phased Plan of Action (with Milestones)

🧩 Phase 1: Core Framework Initialization

    Goal: Lay down the structural backbone and runtime loop to support evolution, context-awareness, and modular growth.
🔹 Tasks:
[x] main.py: Core event loop and system cycle logic.
[x] ContextManager: System-wide state, tick intervals, environment inputs.
[x] MetaAgent: Manages micro-agents, triggers agent spawning, task coordination.
[x] KnowledgeBase: Stores patterns, memory, usage stats, module decisions.
[x] MutationEngine: Handles evolutionary mutation and rollback.
[x] Logger system: Color logs, rotating files, critical error tracking (utils/logger.py).
🛠 Milestone: AI system boots, initializes agents, logs cycles, and can mutate dummy modules.

---

🧠 Phase 2: Agentic Intelligence & Micro-Agent System

    Goal: Build the decentralized, modular intelligence model that enables emergent behavior.
🔹 Tasks:
[x] Micro-agent base class (core/agent_base.py): Executes small context-bound tasks.
[x] Task scheduler/arbiter inside MetaAgent (core/meta_agent.py).
[x] Local feedback loops within agents (core/agent_rl.py, core/performance_tracker.py).
[x] Inter-agent communication protocols (engine/communication_bus.py, core/capability_handlers.py).
[x] Agent lifecycle: spawn, retire, evolve (core/mutation_engine.py, core/meta_agent.py).
🛠 Milestone: System runs multiple agents with feedback-driven behavior and task optimization.

---

🔄 Phase 3: Self-Assessment & Evolution Engine

    Goal: Enable introspection, mutation, and rollback for truly evolving behavior.
🔹 Tasks:
[x] Define assessment criteria: performance, complexity, utility, redundancy (engine/fitness_engine.py).
[x] Run experimental mutations and sandbox testing (core/mutation_engine.py).
[x] Implement rollback + fallback strategies (e.g., capability fallbacks in capability_handlers/).
[x] Pattern-driven evolution logic (core/agent_rl.py, engine/fitness_engine.py).
🛠 Milestone: System detects inefficiencies and modifies its architecture autonomously.

---

🌐 Phase 4: Adaptive API & Interface Evolution

    Goal: Build context-sensitive APIs and expose internal systems for interaction.
🔹 Tasks:
[x] Flask or FastAPI server with middleware (api/system_api.py using Flask).
[x] Dynamic endpoint generation based on internal modules (API exposes dynamic agent data).
[x] Context-aware request parsing and agent triggering (api/system_api.py for user feedback, core/meta_agent.py for user goals).
[x] Web interface or CLI bridge for live interaction (gui.py as a GUI).
🛠 Milestone: Adaptive API available with endpoints that evolve based on system state.

---

🧠 Phase 5: Memory, Learning & Knowledge Retention

    Goal: Enable dynamic long/short-term memory, relevance scoring, and pattern reuse

🔹 Tasks:
[x] Long-term knowledge graph or vector memory (memory/knowledge_base.py for structured storage, memory/fact_memory.py for facts)
[x] Relevance and decay scoring for knowledge entries (Basic contribution score in KnowledgeBase, further enhancements needed)
[x] Knowledge-backed agent spawning and mutation bias (Mutation uses fitness, knowledge as a factor in fitness)
[x] Iterative learning loop (unsupervised/self-supervised) (core/agent_rl.py, engine/fitness_engine.py)

🛠 Milestone:
    System reuses past knowledge to enhance future decisions and module structures (Partially achieved)

---

🌱 Phase 6: Self-Naming & Identity Emergence

    Goal: Let the system derive and define its own name, purpose, and structure

🔹 Tasks:
[x] Monitor dominant traits (speed, efficiency, creativity, etc.) (Fitness engine calculates some metrics, IdentityEngine logs them)
[x] Synthesize a name based on contextual performance (Logic for one-time naming post-maturity implemented)
[/] Feedback visualization module (charts, agent maps, logs) (GUI provides logs and basic status, advanced charts/maps needed)

🔜 Milestone:
    System self-names, defines its function, and visualizes its evolution

**🧠 Phase 7: Advanced Cognitive Development & Organizational Intelligence (Praxis MK2)**

    **Goal:** Integrate intrinsic motivation, basic creativity, open-ended goal setting, and foundational higher-order cognitive abilities within a more sophisticated hierarchical agent structure, enabling greater autonomy and complex problem-solving.

**Sub-Phase 7.A: Foundation - Enhanced Self-Awareness & Basic Intrinsic Drives**
*Goal: Improve data collection for learning and introduce initial internal motivations.*

🔹 Tasks:
[ ] **1. Enhanced Failure Logging (Metacognition Foundation):** `TaskAgent`s log detailed context for capability failures in `AgentMemory`.
[ ] **2. Explicit Confidence Logging (Metacognition Foundation):** `TaskAgent`s log a confidence score with chosen actions.
[ ] **3. Basic Knowledge Gap Identification (Metacognition Foundation):** `TaskAgent`s log when critical information is not found in the `KnowledgeBase`.
[ ] **4. Curiosity via Parameter Novelty Rewards (Intrinsic Motivation):** Modify reward/fitness logic to reward `TaskAgent`s for using capabilities with novel/infrequent parameters. Extend `CapabilityPerformanceTracker`.
[ ] **5. Information Gain Rewards (Intrinsic Motivation):** Reward agents for contributing verifiably "new" information to the `KnowledgeBase`.

**Sub-Phase 7.B: Early Agent Autonomy & Improved Goal-Directed Behavior**
*Goal: Enable agents to act more proactively based on internal states and handle tasks with more sophisticated planning within the hierarchical structure.*

🔹 Tasks:
[ ] **6. Self-Generated Exploration Sub-Goals (Intrinsic Motivation -> Open-Ended Goals):** "Task Supervisor" agents generate internal exploration goals based on curiosity rewards or identified knowledge gaps.
[ ] **7. Agent-Level Goal to Improve Capability Usage (Open-Ended Goals & Metacognition):** "Task Supervisors" (and "Skillset Supervisors") set internal goals to improve their/their domains capability usage based on failure/confidence logs.
[ ] **8. Simple Hierarchical Planning (Complex Strategic Planning):** "Task Manager" agents (and "Task Supervisors") use `llm_planner` to break complex goals into high-level sub-goals, enabling delegation.
[ ] **9. Rudimentary Contingency Handling (Complex Strategic Planning & Metacognition):** "Task Supervisors" attempt predefined alternative actions upon skill invocation failures, potentially escalating to "Task Managers."

**Sub-Phase 7.C: Emergence of System-Level Strategy and Advanced Cognition**
*Goal: Elevate decision-making for system-wide adaptation and introduce more profound cognitive functions, leveraging the full agent hierarchy.*

🔹 Tasks:
[ ] **10. System-Level Metric Improvement Goals (Open-Ended Goals via MetaAgent):** The `MetaAgent` ("The Boss") sets system-wide improvement goals (e.g., for "Naming Mechanism" criteria), influencing "Task Manager" and `MutationEngine` priorities.
[ ] **11. MetaAgent-Level Resource Trend Analysis (Complex Strategic Planning):** The `MetaAgent` analyzes aggregate performance/resource data (from "Managers" and "Skillset Supervisors") to strategically guide `MutationEngine` in evolving the agent population.
[ ] **12. Enhanced "Radical" Mutations (True Creativity Foundation):** `MutationEngine` attempts more structurally novel mutations (e.g., conceptual blending of skills), possibly guided by `MetaAgent` goals or "Skillset Supervisor" requests.
[ ] **13. Conceptual Tagging of Knowledge (Abstract Thought Foundation):** Agents or specialized "LibrarianAgents" use LLMs to add abstract conceptual tags to `KnowledgeBase` entries.
[ ] **14. Rewarding Unexpectedly Effective Solutions (True Creativity):** `FitnessEngine` gives bonus rewards to agents/teams that solve goals using statistically novel or highly efficient methods.
[ ] **15. Simple Analogical Retrieval for New Problems (Abstract Thought):** "Task Supervisors" or "Managers" query `KnowledgeBase` using conceptual tags to find and adapt solutions from analogous past problems.

🛠 **Milestone for Phase 7:**
    Praxis demonstrates rudimentary intrinsic motivation in its agents, begins to set simple internal goals, shows early signs of creative problem-solving through novel mutations or solution paths, and utilizes a basic hierarchical agent structure for task management and issue escalation.

🔬 Phase 8: Protopraxis (Experimental Application)

    Goal: Transition the self-evolving AI (now enhanced by MK2 capabilities) from internal optimization and self-definition towards practical application and interaction with more complex, external goals or environments. Focus on demonstrating learned capabilities in novel scenarios.

🔹 Tasks:
[ ] Define standardized interfaces for external task injection and result retrieval.
[ ] Develop or integrate with a "challenge environment" (e.g., complex simulation, real-world data processing pipeline, advanced scientific query like yeast strain analysis).
[ ] Measure the systems adaptability, strategic planning, and creative problem-solving in externally defined scenarios.
[ ] Enhance long-term strategic planning capabilities based on Protopraxis performance.
[ ] Refine GUI for monitoring and interacting with these advanced practical exercises.

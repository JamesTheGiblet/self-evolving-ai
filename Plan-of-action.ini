🧬 Self-Evolving AI System: Praxis
📅 Phased Plan of Action (with Milestones)

---
🧩 **Phase 1: Core Framework Initialization**
---
**Summary of Phase 1:**
This initial phase focused on establishing the foundational architecture for Praxis. The primary objective was to create a stable structural backbone and a functional runtime loop capable of supporting future evolution, context-awareness, and modular agent-based growth. Key components developed included the core event loop, context management, agent orchestration via the MetaAgent, basic knowledge storage, the initial mutation engine, and a robust logging system.

    Goal: Lay down the structural backbone and runtime loop to support evolution, context-awareness, and modular growth.
🔹 Tasks:
[x] main.py: Core event loop and system cycle logic.
[x] ContextManager: System-wide state, tick intervals, environment inputs.
[x] MetaAgent: Manages micro-agents, triggers agent spawning, task coordination.
[x] KnowledgeBase: Stores patterns, memory, usage stats, module decisions.
[x] MutationEngine: Handles evolutionary mutation and rollback.
[x] Logger system: Color logs, rotating files, critical error tracking (utils/logger.py).

🛠 **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 1):**
The AI system successfully boots, initializes all core modules, and manages a basic population of agents. It can log system cycles and agent activities, and the MutationEngine can perform rudimentary mutations on dummy modules. This provides a solid, operational foundation for developing more intelligent and adaptive behaviors in subsequent phases.

---
🧠 **Phase 2: Agentic Intelligence & Micro-Agent System**
---
**Summary of Phase 2:**
With the core framework in place, Phase 2 concentrated on building the decentralized, modular intelligence model. This involved developing the base class for micro-agents, establishing task scheduling within the MetaAgent, implementing local feedback loops for agent learning (Reinforcement Learning and performance tracking), defining inter-agent communication protocols, and creating the agent lifecycle management (spawn, retire, evolve).

    Goal: Build the decentralized, modular intelligence model that enables emergent behavior.
🔹 Tasks:
[x] Micro-agent base class (core/agent_base.py): Executes small context-bound tasks.
[x] Task scheduler/arbiter inside MetaAgent (core/meta_agent.py).
[x] Local feedback loops within agents (core/agent_rl.py, core/performance_tracker.py).
[x] Inter-agent communication protocols (engine/communication_bus.py, core/capability_handlers.py).
[x] Agent lifecycle: spawn, retire, evolve (core/mutation_engine.py, core/meta_agent.py).

🛠 **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 2):**
The system can now run multiple, distinct micro-agents (TaskAgents and SkillAgents) simultaneously. These agents exhibit feedback-driven behavior, make decisions based on local learning, communicate with each other, and are subject to an evolutionary lifecycle managed by the MetaAgent and MutationEngine, leading to early forms of task optimization and emergent behaviors.

---
🔄 **Phase 3: Self-Assessment & Evolution Engine**
---
**Summary of Phase 3:**
This phase aimed to empower Praxis with genuine self-improvement capabilities. The focus was on enabling robust introspection, refining the mutation processes, and implementing safety mechanisms like rollback. This involved defining clear assessment criteria for agent and system performance, conducting experimental mutations in a controlled manner, and developing pattern-driven evolution logic.

    Goal: Enable introspection, mutation, and rollback for truly evolving behavior.
🔹 Tasks:
[x] Define assessment criteria: performance, complexity, utility, redundancy (engine/fitness_engine.py).
[x] Run experimental mutations and sandbox testing (core/mutation_engine.py).
[x] Implement rollback + fallback strategies (e.g., capability fallbacks in capability_handlers/).
[x] Pattern-driven evolution logic (core/agent_rl.py, engine/fitness_engine.py).

🛠 **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 3):**
Praxis can autonomously detect inefficiencies in its agents or overall architecture based on defined fitness criteria. The MutationEngine can apply more sophisticated, pattern-driven mutations and, crucially, the system has mechanisms to test these changes and roll them back if they prove detrimental, leading to more stable and effective self-evolution.

---
🌐 **Phase 4: Adaptive API & Interface Evolution**
---
**Summary of Phase 4:**
The objective of Phase 4 was to build external interfaces for interaction and monitoring, making the systems internal state and capabilities accessible. This included developing a context-sensitive API that can adapt over time and a graphical user interface for live interaction and observation.

    Goal: Build context-sensitive APIs and expose internal systems for interaction.
🔹 Tasks:
[x] Flask or FastAPI server with middleware (api/system_api.py using Flask).
[x] Dynamic endpoint generation based on internal modules (API exposes dynamic agent data).
[x] Context-aware request parsing and agent triggering (api/system_api.py for user feedback, core/meta_agent.py for user goals).
[x] Web interface or CLI bridge for live interaction (gui.py as a GUI).

🛠 **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 4):**
An adaptive API is operational, providing endpoints that can reflect the current state and capabilities of the evolving system. A GUI allows for real-time monitoring of key system metrics, agent populations, and facilitates user interaction through goal submission and feedback mechanisms.

---
🧠 **Phase 5: Memory, Learning & Knowledge Retention**
---
**Summary of Phase 5:**
This phase focuses on significantly enhancing Praxiss ability to learn, remember, and reuse knowledge effectively. Key goals include implementing robust long-term memory structures, developing relevance and decay mechanisms for stored information, enabling knowledge to influence agent spawning and mutation, and refining iterative learning loops.

    Goal: Enable dynamic long/short-term memory, relevance scoring, and pattern reuse.
🔹 Tasks:
[x] Long-term knowledge graph or vector memory (memory/knowledge_base.py for structured storage, memory/fact_memory.py for facts)
[x] Relevance and decay scoring for knowledge entries (Basic contribution score in KnowledgeBase, further enhancements needed)
[x] Knowledge-backed agent spawning and mutation bias (Mutation uses fitness, knowledge as a factor in fitness)
[x] Iterative learning loop (unsupervised/self-supervised) (core/agent_rl.py, engine/fitness_engine.py)

🛠 **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 5):**
Praxis possesses a more sophisticated memory system with mechanisms for relevance scoring and knowledge decay. It demonstrates the ability to reuse past knowledge (stored in its KnowledgeBase and FactMemory) to inform current decision-making and to bias its evolutionary processes, leading to more informed and efficient adaptation. (Partially Achieved: Core structures exist, advanced scoring and reuse are ongoing refinements).

---
🌱 **Phase 6: Self-Naming & Identity Emergence**
---
**Summary of Phase 6:**
The goal of this highly aspirational phase is to enable Praxis to develop a sense of its own identity by deriving and defining its own name, purpose, and understanding of its structure based on its emergent properties and operational history. This involves monitoring dominant system traits and implementing the logic for name synthesis.

    Goal: Let the system derive and define its own name, purpose, and structure.
🔹 Tasks:
[x] Monitor dominant traits (speed, efficiency, creativity, etc.) (Fitness engine calculates some metrics, IdentityEngine logs them)
[x] Synthesize a name based on contextual performance (Logic for one-time naming post-maturity implemented)
[/] Feedback visualization module (charts, agent maps, logs) (GUI provides logs and basic status, advanced charts/maps needed)

🔜 **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 6):**
The system actively monitors its emergent characteristics and performance. Upon reaching pre-defined criteria for maturity and complexity, Praxis successfully synthesizes and declares its own unique name and a refined purpose statement, embedding this identity within its operational logs and memory. Enhanced visualization tools allow observation of its evolutionary trajectory and current state.

[ ] 15. Simple Analogical Retrieval for New Problems (Abstract Thought): "Task Supervisors" or "Managers" query `KnowledgeBase` using conceptual tags to find and adapt solutions from analogous past problems.

🛠 **Milestone (Conclusion of Phase 7):**
Praxis demonstrates rudimentary intrinsic motivation, with agents pursuing self-generated exploratory sub-goals. It can set simple internal goals for capability improvement and uses basic hierarchical planning. Early signs of creative problem-solving emerge through novel mutations or solution paths. The system utilizes a foundational hierarchical agent structure (Workers, Task Supervisors, Task Managers, Skillset Supervisors under the MetaAgent) for task management and issue escalation, showing increased operational sophistication and autonomy.
